<span style="color:white; font size:10px">Disturbance through human hunting activity can significantly impact prey species through both consumptive and nonconsumptive effects. The nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on Northern Bobwhite (*Colinus virginianus*; hereafter, bobwhite) could cause an increased perceived risk of predation by bobwhite during rabbit hunting events may elicit anti-predator responses, such as reduced movement away from the safety of cover, among bobwhite. </span>

<span style="color:white; font size:10px">Advertisement signaling is usually linked to intersexual selection and intrasexual competition and thus is a key component of a species’ ecology. Using a novel spatial tracking system, the authors tested whether or not the spatial behavior of male and female great tits (*Parus major*) changes in relation to the response of a territorial male neighbor to an intruder. They tracked the spatial behavior of male and female great tits (N = 20), 1 hr before and 1 hr after simulating territory intrusions. </span>

<span style="color:white; font size:10px">In this study, 20 individuals were measured 2 times, 1 hour before playback and 1 hour after. The individuals are separated by sex to look at the different distances between females and males. Distance on the Y axis is measured in meters, with distance being how many meters away a bird was detected before and after a playback recording was played of a territorial male's song.
Based on the measurements of distance before and after playback, it looks like there isn't really a pattern of whether or not sex plays a role in an individual bird's movement after a territorial playback.</span>
